# 🌦️ Weather App (SkyCast)

A modern and responsive **Weather Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, powered by real-time weather data from an external API.  
This project demonstrates practical usage of the **Fetch API**, `.then()` promises, and dynamic DOM manipulation to display live weather conditions.
